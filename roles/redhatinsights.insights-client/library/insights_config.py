    required: false

EXAMPLES = '''
- name: Configure the insights client to register with username and password
    insights_config:
      username: "rhn_support" or "{{ redhat_portal_username }}" if passing in as a role variable
      password: "rhn_password" or "{{ redhat_portal_password }}"
      auto_config: False or "{{ auto_config }}"
      authmethod: BASIC or "{{ authmethod }}"
      proxy: "{{ insights_proxy }}"
  become: true

- name: Configure the insights client to register with RHSM and no display name
    insights_config:
  become: true

Note: The above example calls the insights_config module with no parameters. This is because auto_config defaults to True
which in turn forces the client to try RHSM (or Satellite)

- name: Configure the insights client to register with RHSM and a display name
    insights_config:
      display_name: "nice_name" or "{{ insights_display_name }}" if passing in as a role variable
  become: true
